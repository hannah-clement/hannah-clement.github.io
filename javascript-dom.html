        <h1> Java-licious & Le Dom </h1>
        <h2> Read on for an overview of JavaScript and the DOM - it's mind blowing stuff, quite figuartively </h2>
        <p>  Handy quick lingo dictionary: 
            'HTML' - HyperText MarkUp Language 
            'CSS' - Cascading Style Sheets
            'Control Flow'- Order statements are executed in a script (standard = top to bottom)
            'Loops' - Prefrom repeated code based on a or many conditions 
            'DOM' - The glue that holds it all together - the Document Object Model
            'Arrays & Objects' - A variable(VAR) that hold more than one value ‚Äúordered list‚Äú[] & object but its real name is ‚Äúunordered list‚Äú or ‚Äúhash‚Äù. We know it is an unordered list if it has labels and it is surrounded by { }
            'Function' - Set of Statements that perfrom a task (its a function too)
        </p>
        HTML and CSS together are the core languages to building a webpage. Think of them like an old married couple sitting on the deck together drinking tea, super happy and super cute. HTML dictates the content and structure of the page while CSS changes the display and design of the page.
        Together they make a whole, very structurally comfortable webpage interface. They work well and complement each other.</p>
        
        <p>The thing is, naturally like in all relationships one is a little more picky that the other - Ms. HTML is fine to share their tea with Mr CSS but unfortunately it's not a two way street. Mr CSS is treemdously picky. And example of this is that within an HTML file, you can write CSS. But woooh nelly you can't write HTML in a CSS file. </p>

        <p>HTML consists of tags and surrounding content that tell the server what each piece of content is, i.e. a heading or a paragraph. Whereas CSS uses singular IDs or classes to pick out these attributes and define their colour, size, design, padding etc. The analogy did absolutely fall away towards the end there but in all fairness - it was a hard one to maintain.</p>

        <p>Control flow and Loops outline how/in what order the code in the script is executed. Control flow is the order of statements that are executed in a script which will run from the top to the bottom. Whereas loops perform a repeated code based on a condition. </p>
        
        <p>Let's minimise this jargon, think of the way you make your morning cup of coffee (or tea - whatever takes your fancy). I'm sure you complete the same steps every morning to make your coffee. Whether that's turning on the kettle first, or getting your favourite cup out etc.</p>
        <p>Personally, I turn the jug on, pick and retrieve my cup, get my jar of instant coffee on the bench at the ready and then stare at the jug. If I'm feeling particularly flashy I'll get a teasppon out to stir.</p>        
        <p>In my admittedly my mind-numbingly boring senario the steps I take from start to finish is the control flow, the loop would come in if on that day I did decide my coffee needed a stir and it would outline the condition of this repeated task i.e. how many times (around and around) I stir my coffee and when to stop. </p>
        <p>Hopefully that was somewhat clear in explaining the Control Flow and the Loop - if not, lucky you - you now know my thrilling morning coffee routine</p>
      
        <p>Now for the DOM, as the name suggests it's important, VIP level. The DOM is the Document Object Model that holds all the information about a website/webpage. You can access it by right clicking and hitting inspect. BOOM. There it is, all very impressive. What you have in front of you is access to html, css, and js. The best thing is you can change it all right there on DOM and see what it looks like instantly. Moreover you can find/highlight and inspect individual elements. Besides being widely fun, you'd use/traverse the DOM when making changes to the website for ease to a) instantly see the changes and b) pinpoint the exact elements where the changes need to be made. </p>
      
        <p>Since an array is an ordered list holding more than one value - to access a specific value we need to outline where in the list the specific value is held. Weirdly the first value is always held at 0 and then follows normally from there. The number(index) of the value wanted is put between []. </p>
        <p>Whereas and object is an unordered list and to pull data from it we use {}. </p>
        
        <p>A function is a block of code, set of statements that can be given a signular name and called upon as many times as need be. 
            function <function-name>()
                {
                    // code to be executed
                };
