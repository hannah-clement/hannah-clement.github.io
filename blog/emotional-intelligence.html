        <h1>We are Getting Emotional?</h1>
        <h2>Oh yes, emotional intelligence (EI) vs. intelligence quotient (IQ)</h2>
        <p>From what I understand, emotional intelligence is the ability to acknowledge and be aware of how one‚Äôs emotions guide or cause reaction and the ability to regulate them. Whereas, IQ encompasses what we (as society) traditionally valued and defined as intelligence - logic, solving problems and understand/explain theory and/or concepts. </p>
        <p>Of course my explanation of the above doesn‚Äôt include all that each is. I've picked out parts that resonate with me.</p>
        <p>Emotional intelligence is important as it gives awareness and control to the person using it. It creates distance and acknowledgement between emotion/feeling and reaction so one does not have to equal the other. It allows for great understanding and inclusion of others' ideas and opinions by creating space to listen and absorb without the barrier of the sentiment that ‚ÄúI am right‚Äù brings. </p>
        <p>Humans are at the end of the day emotional beings, to be able to regulate and/or understand our emotions and reactions means that we can better connect to ourselves and others around us.
