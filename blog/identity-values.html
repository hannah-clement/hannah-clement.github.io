        <h1>An Ode to Code & Moi</h1>
        <h2>My name is Hannah and yes you can spell it backwards :D</h2>
        <p>Iâ€™m based in Newtown in Wellington in a flat of 6 living with some fantastic people. Recently, Iâ€™ve been thinking a lot about values especially in light of coming to the decision to apply for Dev Academy. 
            I value community, relationships, kindness, humour and honesty - just to name a few.  
        <p>In terms of identity, Iâ€™m working through what that means to me and love a good conversation about it. 
            Iâ€™m attending Dev Academy to dive headfirst into a rapidly progressive field and join the fun of helping to build the digital future. I love to learn and I see it as an amazing opportunity to add to my current skill set. 
            Already, Dev Academy has already been a life changer for me even after one week!</p>
