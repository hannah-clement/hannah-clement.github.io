      <h1>We Got a Problem?</h1>
      <h2>Blocked straight off of the bat.</h2>
    
            <p>How’s that for a sporty analogy? Here let me hit you with another. This is the problem solving story of how I golden ducked myself.</p>

            The simple problem that I got ‘blocked’ as I suggested with the golden duck-ed the first problem on the first repl. It didn’t make me feel that good in all honesty. For context the simple<em>  problem was: 

            <p>Make secretNumber a number.  

            Blew my mind, truly I thought I knew the answer but running the test it repeatedly returned false and in all honestly I was only about 40% sure. Being the first question and already on shaky ground did not make me feel that great about; 

            a) Not knowing the answer 
            b) Not being able to find the answer 

            And made me really not want to ask on the Slack channels for mild (but still intense) fear and embarrassment.   

            Firstly, I tried giving the question a good Google. But unfortunately I wasn’t able to find anything that didn’t look similar to my answer. In vain, I spent another hour or so Googling how to correct it but still found nothing.  

            At this point I did try the ‘try something’ problem solving strategy where I deleted a few symbols and reran the test. I was able to come up with 3 other ways of what I thought was saying the same thing but none of them worked. A real quandary. 
            As for other problem solving strategies this early on pseudocode was off of the table. I wasn’t confident with reading the eros messages and console.logging didn’t apply. 

            Nothing was left to do except ask my peers and my facilitators. 

            AND THANK GOODNESS I did. 

            I asked and had the answer within 5 minutes thanks to some great guidance from the community. I was guided to see what had gone slightly wrong with my code and with that knowledge I was able to change it, learn from the experience and move on.  

            It doesn’t come across as the most elegant way to problem solve but what I did learn there is that you can trip up on the little things and it’s okay, even good to ask for help. A fresh pair of eyes is sometimes what you need.  
            Other problem solving techniques I tried through the processes were: 

            Pseudocode - This one was super handy! It forced me to write out my logic throughout my problem solving process. It definitely kept me on the right path, even if that path did feel like it was quick sand sometimes.
            
            
            The rubber ducky method - I did give this one a go initially. I didn't find it quite as helpful in the early stages of my problem solving. This was because I really needed to be able to reference specific functions etc that I was going to use, but they kept floating out of my brain which made me a little more flustered.
            
            Console.logging - Love, love, love console.logging. Before I set off to do Sprint 4 I didn't really understand or get what all the fuss was about. BUT me oh my it's a life saver. I used it frequently throughout my code flow to see the output of what I thought I had done was what I really had done.
            
            Googling - Always and forever. Googling previous examples of how other coders (omg!!) had completed similar problems was super helpful. Although I did find it did put me slightly off kilter as I did find myself following them a little too closely once or twice.
            
            However, I can never ever ever go wrong with Googling definitions, methods, functions etc. Well that's not true I can, but Google always gets it right <3
            
            Trying something - At first I tried and didn't succeed and tried, tried again. But I do think that in the later repels I got to a stage where I was blocked and had nothing else logical to try... cue...
            
            ...Asking your peers for help - Now this one worked a treat. I reached out on Slack with a few questions and got an awesome response. As mentioned Dylan was able to guide me through and help me in my understanding of the challenges.</p>
