        <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h3>
        <p>
          My long term goal and/or career pathway is to be fluent in HTML, CSS and JS and combined with my marketing/advertising bring ideas to life, literally on the web. At this stage I do think itâ€™s too early for me to carve out my specific pathway as Iâ€™m still in the introductory levels of code. I want to explore all the avenues and see what Iâ€™m most drawn to! 

          Letâ€™s watch this space. 

        </p>
        <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h3>

        <p>
          My strengths would be talking, making friends and working in teams. My weaknesses are being able to be comfortable with being uncomfortable and keep learning 
          Iâ€™m used to being uncomfortable but usually about things that I control - this really is a whole new world. 
        </p>
        <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
        <p>
          Having confidence in my solutions and seriously putting my ideas forward and being able to back and justify them. Also asking questions - Iâ€™ve talked about this before but I just need to do this - just do, thanks Nike. 
        </p>
        <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
        <p>
          Putting self doubt on the back burner or perhaps just outside the kitchen or house all together.  
        </p>

        <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
        <p>
          Generally speaking to provide a helpful, educational and supportive environment that we all want to be a part of. I know for myself and have heard from others that there are some anxiety and  stress-y thoughts going into the Bootcamp. From the handbook I see that this is totally the case - the team is so supportive and understanding of the pressures which is great. 
        </p>

        <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
        <p>
          To be disciplined and focused on the course and the content. And for the three months I have it as my unwavering number one priority. I want to make the most out of this opportunity and I donâ€™t want to look back and think that I did let myself down. Oh also to look after my mental and physical health - remember I donâ€™t have to be stressed and exhausted to feel like Iâ€™m working hard and achieving. 
        </p>

        <h2>Week 1: Sprint 1 Answers</h2>
        <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h3>
        
        <p>My term goal is made up of short term goals. Firstly, to work consistently through each of the sprints within both the foundations and bootcamp sections of the course primarily focusing on my comprehension of theory and ability to implement it. Secondly sticking to my devised learning routine to ensure focus is also very important. In this way I hope to provide myself with a holistic set of skills to move forward with in my dev career. Ultimately, my long term goal is to get a job in web dev at the moment - I want to be able to competently use my skills and broaden my horizons. </p>
 
        <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h3>
        
        <p>My strengths of learning are that I am a very hard worker, I am willing and able to put the time into my tasks and will spend more than the allocated time to further my learning and understanding. This is a double edged sword where my time management does become a limitation of mine. I need to be able to implement one of the time management strategies that we explored in the prep foundations. One that did particularly stand out to me was the pomodoro technique where I use a specified period of time and work within that to achieve the task. Moreover, I will need to be okay with trusting the 'just in time' learning strategy which I think will massively aid in my time keeping skills holding off on the time sucking granular level that I can go to. Another limitation I have is that I am not a great speller - I will have to be veeeeery aware of that when writing my code. </p>

        <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
        
        <p>I would love love love to develop my skills in presenting my ideas formally or informally to a group. I tend to be able to freely and happily "banter" in groups but not be able to communicate my ideas confidently or take part in robust conversations.  </p>
    
        <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives, what you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you? </h3>
        
        <p>I will manage my time through using one of the time keeping strategies that we were presented with in the foundations prep work specifically the pomodoro method. However, instead of using 25 minute increments I will use 60mins as I think I would more effectively not stopping quite so readily as it allows me to keep in my flow. I will also be setting a firm BUT achieving a routine which allows me to achieve my goals for the day. I have noted that I am very efficient in the early hours of the morning til around 1pm so I would set up my learning new theories/concepts in the morning and leave reflection to the afternoon. </p>
        <p>In terms of learning alongside others I will be conscious of their routines and have an understanding that the best way that I learn is not necessarily theres. For facilitators and community representatives first and foremost interact with all with respect to them, of their time and their abilities. </p>

        <p>When things are building up I have found taking some time away from the task to be wildly beneficial. Also to remember to break it down into bite sized actions and goals. Another technique I really like is the rubber duck where I try to explain the problem in plain english and hope that triggers an action. If I get overwhelmed, which is inevitable, I will go for a break and write down a plan of how to approach the task from another perspective as the current path is obviously not working. </p>
        
        <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
        
        <p>In my short time at Dev Academy I have learnt that if you're stuck for more than 45mins to an hour on a task ask for help! My first port of call will be the Slack community and from there my facilitator. When I first started Dev I was of the mindset that I could figure it all out if I just spent more time on the problem however I found that a. I could not or b. the solution would take me 7 hours to reach whereas asking the Slack community I would have an answer within 10mins. </p>
        
        <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
        
        <p>I would expect, from which I have already experienced from my facilitator, to be a sounding board for best practise, answer or provide help to answer any unanswerable course related questions. Also sometimes it's just nice to have someone who can listen and also understands and provide some advice. </p>
