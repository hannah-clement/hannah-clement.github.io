        <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
            As a result of the core learning over these 5 weeks, I have learnt so much about myself and itâ€™s not all great. But the more you know you know, right. They do say knowledge is power.  

            Right so with regard to myself I have learnt that I love love love to plan my time and set goals that are wildly unachievable. For example,I noticed sometimes I would write smaller tasks on my list after I had completed them just so I could cross them off. The takeaway here for me is to set realistic timeframes and goals instead of unrealistic ones that I canâ€™t achieve and beat myself up for. 

            Hello Ego. 

            I have learned that like most my ego is pervasive and does affect my ability to learn, whether itâ€™s in the form of being so hesitant to ask people questions as I feel bad. What Iâ€™ve learnt (hopeful) still learning is that I should just do it - just reach out.

        </p>   

        <h3>What are the roles of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>

        <p>
            They really are every bit as important as being able to perform technically. 
            Values and empathy shape how the problem/challenge can be approached and solved. As well as how to relate, work with and treat people within the team and yourself. 

            Self awareness is a step back from simply reacting and allows you space from yourself and question the presence of the ego and perhaps allows you to be not so hard on yourself or others and relate to them more.

        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        
        <p>
            And what surprised me the most about learning core is how much your brain, ability and learning capacity can change and grow through active (I think thatâ€™s the term) practise. Which is obviously hard work but changing the shape of something (a.k.a the brain) is. But it is possible illustrated in the concepts of neuroplasticity and growth mindsets.

        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        
        <p>
            The most challenging aspect of core learning for me was within Sprint 1 specifically the introducing yourself exercise. I found this particularly hard as I found having to explain what I valued and who I am as I tend to lean away from those types of experiences and conversations. Itâ€™s not that I donâ€™t want to have them or talk about it, it just feels for me a very vulnerable uncontrollable space that is very left open to others' judgement. End of diary entry lol x0

        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>

        <p>
            Essentially at the end of the day, we are all human and we need to be able to understand, communicate and work with one another. Therefore core learning is essential to any job, and any industry to be successful (not in terms of money but within the job role and greater team). 

            These core skills are pivotal in stressful workloads and we all know that coding can definitely get that way.  

            Also people do say that learning computer languages(HTML,CSS & JS) is like learning a new language, so learning 3 at a time, is at times, mildly mindblowing to say the least. So if such emotional intelligence skills were not taught a lack of awareness of learning habits, self belief and values could unravel process or ability with the pressure. 

            Iâ€™m not sure these core skills were valued in the past as much as they are today. Take for example emotional intelligence is a relatively recent concept in comparison to IQ. Programming is a skill and or profession that is in constant change and progression. One always has to be open to learning more and more. Therefore being such a progressive industry it seems crucial that such skills are taught and valued.

        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>

        <p>
            No, not at all. Personally I think it gave me a clearer roadmap of myself and my intrinsic beliefs and learning ability.  The skills that I learnt from core enable me to build learning habits more intune to my own brain and itâ€™s needs rather than being defined by others. 


            Essentially when I first started doing and completing the weekly Sprints I would be in constant panic mode thinking that Iâ€™d never get it. Through learning about how I learn, and deep diving into emotional intelligence concepts I could understand that it wasnâ€™t that I would never get it but just that I hadnâ€™t understood the conceptâ€¦.yet.
