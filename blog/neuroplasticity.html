        <h1>Food for thought</h1>
        <h2>Change is possible, let's not wait</h2>
        <p>Understanding neuroplasticity benefits people on a multitude of levels. It gives people the understanding, power/ability and perhaps even a superpower to change not only their perception of the world and society but the shape of their brains. Literally. 

            Definitively speaking, it is ‚Äúthe selective organising of connections between neurons in our brains.‚Äù Neuroplasticity is centred on the idea that the brain is not static nor unchanging instead it‚Äôs quite the opposite, the brain changes all the time - everyday. Neuroplasticity maintains the idea that our brains are plastic and totally malleable.  We have the power to shape the shape of our brains just by thinking and it‚Äôs scientifically proven. 
            
            From a Neuroscientific standpoint imagining an action and doing it use the same neural networks and can achieve similar outcomes. The same happens with repeated practice or accessing a memory, the process fires groups of neurons together, creating electrochemical pathways that form our understanding. 
            
            Each thought changes the structure and function of your brain by affecting the neurons at a microscopic level.  If the benefit isn‚Äôt clear, the answer is that we have the power as people to change the shape of our brains, change the way they work, change what we excel in and the best part? The limit is not even known...yet. 
            
            Instantly understanding the principles of neuroplasticity gives me hope and motivation. I‚Äôm often and have been very stuck at most stages of this course, understanding neuroplasticity gives me another strategy to get, for lack of a better word, unstuck. 
            Simply by taking a step back from the problem and imaging that I did work it out, or imagining that I did achieve my daily goals creates a space in which I actually could, can and will do. Or putting information in context would help me tie such theoretical concepts into already developed pathways and cement my understanding. And of course, last but not least,  practise, practise, practise, practise, practise, practise, practise, practise, practise, practise, practise, practise, practise and practise. 
            
            With neuroplasticity it‚Äôs all about imagination and action. So obviously imagining an action, alongside physically practising it and tying it to stronger pathways increases your neuroplasticity. And once the network is stimulated, the stronger and more efficient it becomes.

            Growth Mindset is similar to neuroplasticity, however it moves the focus away from the brain instead conceptualises our ‚Äòability‚Äô as malleable, non static and that it can be developed. The two concepts obviously do intertwine and are interdependent on one another.  
            
            The Growth Mindset is relevant and important for people to understand as it moves people away from the idea that particular people are better suited or more gifted and naturally more intelligent than others. To a place where anyone's ability can be fostered and amplified by changing the messaging and environment. 
            
            Surprisingly enough, the Growth Mindset gives scientific backing to the famous and ever elusive ‚Äúthe world is your oyster.‚Äù To start thinking of developing abilities instead of being born that is proven to work creates an awesome pathway forward that‚Äôs positive, scientifically speaking. It proves that through practise, engaging with our errors instead of ignoring them and putting in the effort pays off. 
            
            Incorporating the Growth Mindset for me has to come into play in embracing the unknown and endless errors. I see that challenge and hard work doesn‚Äôt equate to ‚Äúnever going to get it.‚Äù And above all remembering that my ability is capable of growth and that in many ways we become what we think we are. So it's time to think differently. (lol Apple).

            Having researched and understood both the concepts of neuroplasticity and the Growth Mindset set I feel hopeful. More hopeful that I have been in the past three weeks of Sprints. 
            
            These concepts will be integrated within my learning strategy on many levels, firstly reminding myself and reflecting upon them every morning before starting work will ground me in my learning and cement that I can do it.  
            
            If I can‚Äôt solve a problem, to incorporate neuroplasticity I‚Äôll try, try again and then step away and imagine myself solving it. 
            
            Incorporating the Growth Mindset into my learning plan will be an on-going process of practise and reevaluating my errors and learning from them. As Dr Carol Dweck said, start ‚Äúluxuriating in the power of yet.‚Äù
